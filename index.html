            <p>Hello, my name is Christopher Teron Wood. I am an aspiring web developer currently attending the Coding Bootcamp at UNC Charlotte.  I also work nights at Harris Teeter selecting and building pallets.  Most importantly, I’m a father of a two year old and I'm about to have a new little one any day now.  To say I’m a busy man is an understatement, but actually I wouldn’t have it any other way.
            </p>
            <p>I am a hard working, driven individual who enjoys being busy.  I am a fast learner and have already acquired skills in HTML and CSS.  I’m excited to be expanding my knowledge in all areas of web development.
            </p>
            <p>I was born in Los Angeles, California and moved to Charlotte, NC in 2012. Charlotte is a nice place to live, but I miss my home - LA. My beautiful daughter, Leia is quite a handful, she tests every ounce of my patience. Being a father has taught me a lot and forced me to grow up - I did fight it every step of the way.  My daughter Aubrey will be here anyday now, I can’t wait to experience the joy and love that I know she will bring to my life. 
            </p>
            <p>I enjoy being active, skateboarding and basketball are my two loves. I’m also a tech geek who loves thinking about how to implement tech into activities that normally wouldn’t use it.  I’m very exited to be changing careers and to actually be working in the tech field. 
            </p>
